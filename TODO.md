## Specific feature wishlist for the short term

* Timeouts on critical plugin operations (load/enable/disable)
* Retry queue for API calls
* Dynamic plugin control with reload support
* Properly test all API methods with various parameters
* Use MongoDB for keeping track of state/users/chats and providing a database
  service for plugins
* Implement more allowPrivate rules (fromKnown, fromPrivileged)
* Create a proper shutdown routine (maybe with node-shutdown-manager)

## High priority plugins

* RSS/Atom feed monitoring
* Message logging and statistics

## Vague wishlist for the long term

* Webinterface
* Plenty of plugins
