## Specific wishlist for the short term

* Timeouts on critical plugin operations (load/enable/disable)
* Handle bot-specific command addressing (i.e. /command@SomeBot)
* Dynamic plugin control with reload support
* Properly test all API methods with various parameters
* Use MongoDB for keeping track of state/users/chats & providing a database service for plugins
* Implement more allowPrivate rules (fromKnown, fromPrivileged)
* Message logging (probably as plugin)

## Vague wishlist for the long term

* Webinterface
* Plenty of plugins
